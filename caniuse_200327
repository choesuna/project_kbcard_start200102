# target-densitydpi : only for Android browser
- device-dpi : Use the device's native dpi as target dpi. force the browser to make a CSS pixel the same size as a device pixel, which may cause content to appear incorrectly scaled on screen.
- low-dpi : 120dpi
- medium-dpi : 160dpi 
- high-dpi : 240dpi
- high-dpi, medium-dpi : may cause content to appear incorrectly scaled on screen.

# inline-block
- over IE8
- over IE7 : only Supported in IE6 and IE7 on elements with a display of "inline" by default. ??
- Until IE8, inline-block is only for natural inline-elements.
In this case, check the doctype and inline-block elements
IE8 cannot switch elements that are block by default to inline-block elements. No matter how hard you try, they will always remain block unless you use float IIRC.
Changing the doctype worked for IE

- hack
display: inline-block;
*display: inline;
*zoom: 1;

- zoom:1 is to triger hasLayout

# display: table-* properties as well as display: inline-table
- over IE8
- table
- table-cell
- table-column
- table-column-group
- table-footer-group
- table-header-group
- table-row
- table-row-group

# table-layout
- value : auto|fixed|initial|inherit;
- auto : default
- fixed : major benefit is performance.
The browser dosen't need to anylize the entire table's content before determining the size of the columns; it only needs to analyze the first row.
contents > width
